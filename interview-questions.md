# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is a visual representation of the code.

Researched answer: The virtual DOM is a copy of the DOM stored in memory as a JavaScript object. The virtual DOM allows for parts of a webpage to be updated without needing to update the entire page.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: If the keyword return is not being used, Ruby will put the last line of the code.

Researched answer: Return's default argument is nil, which is a falsey value.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: JavaScript and Ruby are both dynamic languages. They both can be used to write logic into the code.

JavaScript is a language oriented around logic. Ruby is an object-oriented language. Unlike JavaScript, Ruby does not use type coercion. Unlike JavaScript, Ruby requires methods and conditional statements to be bound by the end keyword. Most of Ruby's methods are accessors, but their methods can be turned into mutators with the bang operator. Ruby has many built-in methods that JavaScript does not have access to. Unlike JavaScript, Ruby does not require the usage of var, const, or let to declare a variable. For conditional statements, JavaScript uses else if, whereas Ruby uses elsif. JavaScript uses the command node to run in the terminal. Ruby uses the command ruby. JavaScript uses null whereas Ruby uses nil. JavaScript uses camelCase for variable and function names. Ruby uses snake_case.

Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby are both object-oriented scripting languages. JavaScript also has access to libraries and frameworks.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A version manager manages changes to code.

Researched answer: Version control is the process of managing and tracking changes to code. Version managers handle language versions. They install required language versions and allow user to switch between them.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: Usually defined witih the keywords do and end, a Ruby block is an anonymous function passed to a method.

2. RSpec: Short for Ruby pecification, RSpec is used for testing the behavior of objects in Ruby. As a domaine specific language, it is only used for one specific task.

3. Test-driven development: Also known as red-green-refactor, TDD is the process of writing tests, watching them fail, and then writing the code that will pass the test.
